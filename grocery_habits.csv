I pick the store based on what I want to buy and at times based on convenience. For example I go to a local bakery for bread. Farmer’s market for fruits if I happen to be in the area otherwise I finish it at the chain store. More recently I have been preferring organic produce at the market more than chain stores.

I usually go to the grocery store with a list of items to buy in mind. For staple ingredients like eggs and milk, I typically shop at Vons. For meat, I prefer Whole Foods, and for frozen foods, I go to Trader Joe's.
